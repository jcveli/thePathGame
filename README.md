A game called The Path is written in java using the Codename One framework. Submitted for CSC 133 (Object-Oriented Computer Graphics Programming) class.  


## Overview/Objective
The Objective of the game is the player (the red circle) will go and touch each flag station (numbered upside-down triangle) **IN ORDER** from one to four. 

The player will need to keep in mind of the player's food level since their food level will continously decrease as they move; the faster they go,
the faster their hunger will increase. There is food scattered in the map (green triangles) that will replenish the player's hunger. 

There is "spiders" (white triangles) that will continously move around the map and if the player touches them, the spider dies and the player's health is decreased by one.
If the player loses all their lives, the game will end.
